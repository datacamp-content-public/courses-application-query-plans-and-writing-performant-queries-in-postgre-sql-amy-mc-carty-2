`@script`
We just learned about different database storage techniques. Now letâ€™s drive into some of the optimization techniques used with row storage, starting with partitions.

## What is Partitioning?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ceb9b0e5db"
```

`@part1`
_**Partitioning is splitting one large (parent) table into smaller (children) tables.**_



**You will Learn the Basics of Partitioning
**
- Why
- Where
- How


`@script`
In this course, you will learn about why partitioning is used and on which type of tables you will find it. We will cover both how to implement in a database and how to access in an analytic query.

## Why and Where to Use Partitions

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c19771dbec"
```

`@part1`
**Why DBAs Use Partitions**
- Improve bulk load and delete performance
- Grants storage flexibility
- Improves security

**Why Analysts Use Partitions**
- Query Performance

**What Tables are best suited for Partitioning?**
- Large Tables
- Commonly used filtering metric


`@script`
Database administrators may opt to utilize partitions for a variety of reasons.
- For instance, adding or deleting a partition can speed bulk loads and deletes that would otherwise operate on an entire table
- Children tables can be stored on different servers and seldom used partitions can be moved to cheaper, slower storage options.
- Separating out sensitive data or data from different customers can help improve security measures.

Analysts and data scientists can then utilize these partitions to improve their query performance. Referencing a partition allows the query to search a subset of data, speeding the process.

It is important to note partitioning requires resources so is not used on every table. Large tables with a common filter condition, such as a date or location common, provide good use cases.

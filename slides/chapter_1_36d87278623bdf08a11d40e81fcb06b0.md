## Creating and Using Partitions

```

`@script`
We just learned about different database storage techniques. Now letâ€™s drive into some of the optimization techniques used with row storage, starting with partitions.

## What is Partitioning?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ceb9b0e5db"
```

`@part1`
_**Partitioning is splitting one large (parent) table into smaller (children) tables.**_



**You will Learn the Basics of Partitioning
**
- Why
- Where
- How


`@script`
In this course, you will learn about why partitioning is used and on which type of tables you will find it. We will cover both how to implement in a database and how to access in an analytic query.

## Why and Where to Use Partitions

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c19771dbec"
```

`@part1`
**Why DBAs Use Partitions**
- Improve bulk load and delete performance
- Grants storage flexibility
- Improves security

**Why Analysts Use Partitions**
- Query Performance

**What Tables are best suited for Partitioning?**
- Large Tables
- Commonly used filtering metric


`@script`
Database administrators may opt to utilize partitions for a variety of reasons.
- For instance, adding or deleting a partition can speed bulk loads and deletes that would otherwise operate on an entire table
- Children tables can be stored on different servers and seldom used partitions can be moved to cheaper, slower storage options.
- Separating out sensitive data or data from different customers can help improve security measures.

Analysts and data scientists can then utilize these partitions to improve their query performance. Referencing a partition allows the query to search a subset of data, speeding the process.

It is important to note partitioning requires resources so is not used on every table. Large tables with a common filter condition, such as a date or location common, provide good use cases.

## Partitioning Terminology

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "393efa4a83"
```

`@part1`
**Declarative Partitioning**
- Partitioned Table
- Partitions
- Partition Key
- Partition Bounds
- Partition Method


`@script`
Declarative partitioning is the native approach in PostgreSQL

The PARTITIONED TABLE is the parent table and it is divided into individual pieces, the PARTITIONS. The PARTITION KEY, the relevant column or expressions, create the divisions and define the PARTITION BOUNDS. The divisions can be created with different PARTITION METHODS, such as using an all inclusive list to define the KEY.

## Setting up a Partition

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "809c9787ca"
```

`@part1`
1. Create the partitioned, or parent, table

2. Create the partitions, or children, tables

3. Create an index

4. Configure postgresql.conf 

5. Perform Maintenance


`@script`
Using PostgreSQL 10 or later, setting up a partition follows these 5 main steps.
1) Create the partitioned, or parent, table
2) Create the partitions, or children, tables. 
- Choose the partitioning method
- Create optional sub-partitions
3) Create an index
4) Configure postgresql.conf 
5) Perform Maintenance

## Setting up a Partition: Partitioned Table

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "c2ea231143"
```

`@part1`
**Partitioned Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_orders (
	customer_id	int not null,
	order_id	int not null,
	order_date	date not null,
	order_year	int,
	product_qty	int
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);
```


`@script`
The partitioned table is created as a normal table, with the PARTITION BY condition added. The children tables will be created using ranges from the order_date column.
